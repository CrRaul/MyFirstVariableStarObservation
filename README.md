# MyFirstVariableStarObservation

-A first attempt, partially failed, of variable star photometry-

After another 3 totally failed attempts( due to the weather or various technical errors) I managed to get a light curve of the star XX Cyg from the constellation Cygnus, after a cold night that convinced me to finish the observation session faster than I would like...

But even with a partial set of data, I obtained the graph below that shows the magnitude variation of the star XX Cyg which is part of an important class of variable stars, known as Delta Scuti.

They are stars that are heading towards the stage of giant stars and in this transition stage, they become unstable and begin to pulsate, changing their brightness periodically. Even simple observation of these stars can yield information about their mass, radius, luminosity and evolution.

Technical details:
Telescope: Skywatcher 200/1000;
Camera: Nikon D5100;
Software: Muniwin and PixInsight.

p.s. I specified that it's a partially failed attempt because in the literature the variability of the star looks a little different( the decrease is more abrupt) and I still don't know why my data doesn't match but next time I will stay as long as it should, 5-6 hours and maybe the result will be the desired one, with several cycles.
